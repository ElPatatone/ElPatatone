## About me

After taking time to reflect on my priorities, my passion for computing was reignited. I have since decided to commit to a career in research.

Right now I am focused on exploring **GPU computing** and how we use modern hardware to accelerate **AI workloads** to solve real-world problems.

**GOAL**: To contribute at the forefront of computing technology, driving innovation in GPUs and next generation architectures to accelerate AI workloads.
