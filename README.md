## About me

After a period of poor health, I took time to reflect on what I truly wanted in life, 
which helped reignite my passion for computer science.

Right now I am exploring the **foundations of Computing** from the silicon
up, with a particular emphasis on **GPU computing**, as well as broader **computer
architecture**. My approach is to peel away abstraction layers and understand how
systems work at a foundational level.

**GOAL**: To contribute at the forefront of computing technology, driving innovation
in GPUs and next generation architectures.
